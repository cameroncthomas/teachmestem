## How to run locally

Clone the repo and install the dependencies in a virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need to add some environment variables too. These are `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.

If running in development, you will probably want to set `DEBUG = True` and `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False`. The `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` keys can be generated by signing up for [reCAPTCHA](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/recaptcha) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) respectively.

Now apply the migrations to the database:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally, create a superuser for access to the admin site:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You are now ready to run the development web server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Enjoy!
